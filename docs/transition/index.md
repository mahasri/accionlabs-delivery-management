## Transition Planning Approach and Methodology

### Transition Methodology Overview

This document describes Accion's methodology and approach to transitioning work from a range of customers' internally managed and vendor-managed teams to an integrated Accion-managed extended delivery center (EDC) composed of product engineering teams at Accionlabs.

### Transition Process Design Principles

Accion's transition process for setting up an extended delivery center (EDC) is primarily guided by the following key principles:

### Low Touch Induction

Accion's transition methodology emphasizes that delivery teams must completely own the delivery process. The low touch approach minimizes dependence on the existing vendor or the client's product organization/technology teams. This is achieved by a combination of training the trainer, self-managed and self-discovery, and progressive induction.

### Progressive Induction - Train the Trainer

The transition process is broken down into phases that incrementally induct Accion's teams. The process starts with a leadership team and a transition team responsible for the overall program, followed by core delivery teams for each work stream, which work closely with the corresponding product owners and technical architects to create a detailed induction guide and delivery plan. The core team then inducts and trains the rest of the delivery team, ensures full ownership of the delivery process, and minimizes the dependence on existing vendor resources.

### Think Ahead, Plan Ahead

The transition methodology is based on a proactive plan that outlines the activities, outcomes, and participants for each transition phase. The methodology also defines the checklists, benchmarks, and metrics that provide the guardrails to highlight any deviations from the plan to allow Accion as well as the client to respond with the requisite actions and ensure a successful transition.

### Seed Teams with Existing Accion Leaders

To ensure that Accion's culture of outcome and action, rapid response, and team spirit is ingrained into the transition process, Accion ensures that a large part of the key leadership, including core delivery leaders, consists of existing Accion engineers. These leaders are experienced with Accion's transition and delivery process and ensure that the methodology is executed accurately and efficiently.

Accion executes the progressive induction by following Accionlabs Induction Framework (5P Model). This methodology incorporates the five key aspects of induction: Product, Platform, People, Process, and Program across four levels: Accion, Client, Project, and Role. This tested and proven induction methodology ensures that each incremental team member of the progressive induction process works exactly as planned with minimal dependence on the individual's experience with the transition process. This also ensures adherence to the think ahead, plan ahead principle.

### Hypercare Governance Mode

For the first 90-120 days or until the last product completes the monitored ramp-up phase, Accion will operate in a Hypercare governance mode. Under this mode, there will be a daily leadership catch-up for 30 days and a weekly catchup for the remainder of 90 days. The goal of the Hypercare phase is to review resource onboarding, induction/training, progress of transition, and resolve any blockers or issues. Hypercare meetings are held at the product level and partnership levels.

- **Daily scrum for core product teams at the start and by the end of the day - Kanban**
  - Key issues & resolution
  - Team ramp-up
  - Delivery metrics
  - Work intake process progress
  - Risk management

- **Daily reporting to client & Accion leadership**
  - Product level breakdown with status on transition, team ramp-up, and ongoing delivery
  - Highlight blockers/issues, risks & mitigation plans

- **Weekly meeting with client & Accion leadership**
  - Engagement review
  - Recruitment status review
  - Schedule and financials review
  - Risk management

## Phase-wise Transition Plan

Accion's transition process comprises several detailed phases designed to ensure a smooth and efficient transition. This comprehensive process includes the following phases:

1. **Prepare**
2. **Plan**
3. **Initiate**
4. **Monitored Ramp Up**
5. **Independent Ramp Up**
6. **Operationalize**

### 1. Prepare Phase

In this phase, Accion leadership and transition teams will collect and collate information from the client's product engineering team and review the collated information around the products' functional and technical documentation from the client and/or its current partner.

#### Activities

**Information Gathering**

- Gain access to non-production environments of the applications to the architects in the Transition team.
- Gain access to source code, product backlog, resource roster, performance benchmarks, and functional and technical knowledge repositories.
- Review current productivity benchmarks, SLAs, and metrics.
- Review the current roster.
- Review of product code and backlog.
- Review product/module-wise workload.
- Review scheduled releases and blackout calendar.
- Finalize infrastructure requirement.
- Support SOPs and SLAs (if applicable).
- SDLC Process, compliance process, current governance process, sample dashboards, metrics, and SLAs.

**Any existing available and applicable documentation around:**
- Functional areas
- Architecture, technologies, integrations, and tools used
- Data flow between systems
- Database schema/design/indexes
- Coding guidelines/best practices
- Test cases and test scripts
- Organization structures

#### Participants

- **Accion leadership team:** Client Sponsor, Global Delivery Manager, Transition Leader
- **Accion transition team:** Transition Manager, Application Architects, HR, Recruitment, and Administration Team
- **Client transition team:** Product Directors, Program Sponsor

#### Outcomes

- Core team induction package based on the 5P Induction Framework.
- Team-wise productivity benchmarks and SLAs.
- Product-wise skills matrix and draft job descriptions.
- Draft transition timelines and plans based on Accion's understanding of the information provided.
- A detailed schedule for the planning phase (named participants, sessions, deliverable templates, etc.).
