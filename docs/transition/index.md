# Transition

## Overview

The transition process is a critical phase in setting up an Extended Delivery Center (EDC) that ensures smooth handover from existing teams to Accion-managed delivery teams. This section covers the comprehensive methodology and approach for transitioning work from customers' internally managed and vendor-managed teams to an integrated Accion-managed extended delivery center.

## Key Principles

### Low Touch Induction
Accion's transition methodology emphasizes that delivery teams must completely own the delivery process. The low touch approach minimizes dependence on the existing vendor or the client's product organization/technology teams. This is achieved by a combination of training the trainer, self-managed and self-discovery, and progressive induction.

### Progressive Induction - Train the Trainer
The transition process is broken down into phases that incrementally induct Accion's teams. The process starts with a leadership team and a transition team responsible for the overall program, followed by core delivery teams for each work stream, which work closely with the corresponding product owners and technical architects to create a detailed induction guide and delivery plan.

### Think Ahead, Plan Ahead
The transition methodology is based on a proactive plan that outlines the activities, outcomes, and participants for each transition phase. The methodology also defines the checklists, benchmarks, and metrics that provide the guardrails to highlight any deviations from the plan.

### Seed Teams with Existing Accion Leaders
To ensure that Accion's culture of outcome and action, rapid response, and team spirit is ingrained into the transition process, Accion ensures that a large part of the key leadership, including core delivery leaders, consists of existing Accion engineers.

## Transition Phases

The transition process comprises several detailed phases designed to ensure a smooth and efficient transition:

1. **Prepare** - Information gathering and initial planning
2. **Plan** - Joint sessions to finalize transition approach
3. **Initiate** - Core team begins work and creates induction materials
4. **Monitored Ramp Up** - Rest of team onboarded with monitoring
5. **Independent Ramp Up** - Teams work independently with oversight
6. **Operationalize** - Full operational delivery

## Hypercare Governance Mode

For the first 90-120 days or until the last product completes the monitored ramp-up phase, Accion will operate in a Hypercare governance mode. Under this mode, there will be a daily leadership catch-up for 30 days and a weekly catchup for the remainder of 90 days.

### Hypercare Focus Areas

- **System uptime & critical SLAs**
- **Daily scrum for core product teams**
- **Daily reporting to client & Accion leadership**
- **Weekly meeting with client & Accion leadership**
- **Risk management and mitigation**
