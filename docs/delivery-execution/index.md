# Delivery Execution

## Innovation Engineering Services (Architecture & Design)

This document outlines how Accion Labs' architecture and design group collaborates with clients during these crucial steps of the Innovation engineering lifecycle, translating strategic vision into concrete technical solutions and actionable plans.

### Introduction

The Innovation Engineering Lifecycle consists of seven key phases:

1. **Strategy & roadmap**
2. **Enterprise architecture, solution architecture & experience design**
3. **Program / Workstream planning**
4. **EDC team setup**
5. **Agile release planning & estimation**
6. **Agile release execution**
7. **Solution support & maintenance**

### Overview

Accion Labs' approach to the architecture, design, and program planning phases emphasizes the parallel execution of architecture design and user experience (UX) design streams, followed by comprehensive program planning. This approach ensures that both technical robustness and user-centricity are given equal importance in the solution development process.

Key activities include enterprise architecture assessment, solution architecture design, user experience design, technical feasibility studies, and detailed program planning. The process involves close collaboration with clients, leveraging Accion Labs' expertise across various technology domains and methodologies.

### Agile Approach to Architecture, Design, and Planning

While the architecture design and experience design streams, and program planning are presented sequentially in this document, it's crucial to understand that Accion Labs employs an agile and iterative approach throughout the Innovation engineering lifecycle. This approach allows flexibility, continuous refinement, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements and emerging insights.

Key aspects of our agile approach include:

1. **Iterative development**: While core architecture and design decisions are made upfront to avoid technical debt, many activities continue through the iterative agile execution phase.

2. **Continuous refinement**: Architecture and design are continuously refined based on insights gained during development and changing business needs.

3. **Parallel workstreams**: Different aspects of architecture, design, and development often progress in parallel, with frequent integration points.

4. **Incremental delivery**: The solution is developed and delivered in increments, allowing for early value realization and frequent feedback.

5. **Adaptive planning**: While high-level planning is done initially, detailed planning is performed iteratively, allowing for adaptation based on new information and changing priorities.

6. **Ongoing activities**: Creation of reusable platforms, components, and design artifacts continues throughout the development process, not just in the initial phases.

This agile approach ensures that while we establish a solid foundation through initial architecture and design work, we can evolve and adapt the solution throughout the development process.

### Parallel Streams: Architecture Design and UX Design

Accion Labs recognizes that architecture design and UX design can and should be executed in parallel. This approach allows for independent yet collaborative work between technical consultants and design consultants and ensures that both technical excellence and user-centricity are achieved simultaneously.
