# Gen AI Adoption

## KAPS Framework

The KAPS framework provides a comprehensive approach to enterprise GenAI transformation, integrating four key pillars: Knowledge, Analytics, Process, and Systems. This holistic framework enables organizations to leverage GenAI capabilities across their entire operational spectrum - from transforming unstructured content into actionable insights, to delivering data-driven analytics, optimizing business processes, and modernizing legacy systems.

By addressing both technological and operational dimensions, KAPS helps organizations systematically identify, implement, and scale GenAI solutions that drive tangible business value. The framework's integrated approach ensures that GenAI adoption aligns with enterprise objectives while maintaining a balanced focus on innovation and practical implementation.

## Generative AI (GenAI) in SDLC

Projects in Accionlabs have been gradually integrating GenAI across the entire SDLC, focusing on key areas that consume developer time and effort. Accionlabs has established a structured framework that guides teams through systematic implementation while ensuring quality and compliance.

This structured approach ensures that the engineering team delivers consistent quality while leveraging GenAI effectively across projects. The framework provides teams with clear guidelines while allowing flexibility for project-specific adaptations, making it easier to scale GenAI adoption across diverse client engagements while maintaining high-quality standards and responsible usage of AI.

The implementation is supported by dedicated Centers of Excellence (CoE) that provide technical guidance, quality assurance, and continuous learning opportunities. This ensures that teams stay updated with the latest GenAI developments while adhering to established quality and security standards.

### Key Focus Areas in SDLC
