# EDC

Our engagement models are structured around the EDC (End-to-End Delivery Cycle) framework, which ensures comprehensive project execution from kickoff to delivery. This systematic approach provides clear entry and exit criteria, well-defined activities, and structured governance throughout the engagement lifecycle.

### Leadership Team

The leadership team comprises the key decision-makers of both the client and Accionlabs. This team will be involved in defining the strategic goals, and delivery expectations. Delivery managers are spread to manage a group of projects.

### Dedicated Teams

The teams are usually grouped based on the product/module they manage for the client. The teams are a mix of lead developers, architects, senior and junior engineers and QA teams, etc based on project priorities, schedule, and project goals. Few resources can be shared between projects like Ops, Design, BA, Architects, etc.

### Support Teams

For any successful EDC model, it is important to have the HR, IT admin, Ops support, and TA teams in sync with the functional and operations expectations of the client.

### Tech CoEs

The core Center of Excellence team from Accionlabs with specialization in specific areas is involved in this group. They support periodical conversations with the team and provide the right guidance and recommendations based on project needs.
