"What makes Accion truly stand out is their shared commitment to purpose. For Rotary, success isn't about profits—it's about global impact. Accion embraced that vision."
</div>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
Our partnership with Accion Labs began as a simple engagement to backfill some open IT positions—but it quickly evolved into something far more strategic. We recognized that instead of constantly chasing talent in a competitive IT market, it made more sense to focus on delivering organizational value and let a trusted partner manage the resourcing. That's when we deepened our relationship with Accion, entrusting them not just with skilled individuals, but with the growth and continuity of our development and QA teams.

What makes Accion truly stand out is their shared commitment to purpose. For Rotary, success isn't about profits—it's about global impact. Accion embraced that vision. They didn't just walk in and win a contract—they earned our trust through a thoughtful RFP process, showing genuine alignment with our values and care for our legacy team members. Today, our collaboration goes beyond a transactional partnership. It's a relationship built on trust, shared goals, and mutual respect.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
Accion Labs has taken the pressure off both sides. Their ability to provide continuity, nurture talent, and support a long-term vision is enabling us to do more for communities around the world. It's a true win-win—and we're grateful for what we've achieved together so far.

<p style="color: #666; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 20px;">SAGE Publications</p>

<div style="background: #f0fff4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1rem; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;">
"This is more than just a vendor relationship—it's a shared journey of growth, learning, and continuous improvement."
</div>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
Our relationship with Accion Labs and MotifWorks spans over a decade—and in many ways, it has matured from a staff augmentation model to a truly strategic partnership. What began as a way to scale our technology teams evolved into something far more impactful when data became central to Sage's digital transformation journey.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
Two years ago, we faced a critical business challenge: accelerating the delivery of a data solution to support our finance function. Accion quickly mobilized the right experts, built a strong team, and within months, we had a stable, agile environment delivering real business value. That solution is now live, drastically reducing hours of manual processing and enabling the business to access data in ways we simply couldn't before.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
But what truly sets this partnership apart is how aligned the teams are with our goals. Accion Labs and MotifWorks didn't just provide resources—they embedded themselves in our business context, asked the right questions, and continuously sought to understand the 'why' behind our initiatives. That level of engagement and critical thinking is rare—and it's what makes this collaboration so powerful.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
As we continue to expand our data footprint, move more systems to the cloud, and embrace new use cases, we're placing a big bet on this relationship. And it's paying off. We've doubled our team size in a year and are achieving milestones faster than we thought possible—because we've found a partner that listens, adapts, and walks with us every step of the way.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
This is more than just a vendor relationship—it's a shared journey of growth, learning, and continuous improvement.

</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
What I value most is the openness of the collaboration. Our teams feel empowered to provide feedback, which is acted upon quickly and constructively. That level of trust and responsiveness has been key to driving real momentum. This isn't just vendor support—it's a strategic partnership helping us build meaningful, connected experiences for families.

The partnership between LeadVenture and Accion Labs has empowered us to achieve more, move faster, and innovate with greater depth. By tapping into Accion Labs' broad spectrum of expertise, we've been able to access a wider headspace of innovation that simply wouldn't have been possible on our own.

From the very beginning, our communication was clear, consistent, and honest. Both teams aligned early on about our goals and the boundaries of the engagement—what we wanted to achieve and what we didn't. That clarity laid a strong foundation for a successful collaboration.
</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">
What truly stood out was the quality and caliber of the talent Accion Labs brought to the table. The knowledge transfer, the team formation process—everything exceeded our already high expectations. It's been an extremely positive experience so far, and we're excited about what we'll continue to build together.
