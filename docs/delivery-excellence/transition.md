# Transition

## Transition Planning Approach and Methodology

### Transition Methodology Overview

This document describes Accion's methodology and approach to transitioning work from a range of customers' internally managed and vendor-managed teams to an integrated Accion-managed extended delivery center (EDC) composed of product engineering teams at Accionlabs.

### Transition Process Design Principles

Accion's transition process for setting up an extended delivery center (EDC) is primarily guided by the following key principles:

### Low Touch Induction

Accion's transition methodology emphasizes that delivery teams must completely own the delivery process. The low touch approach minimizes dependence on the existing vendor or the client's product organization/technology teams. This is achieved by a combination of training the trainer, self-managed and self-discovery, and progressive induction.

### Progressive Induction - Train the Trainer

The transition process is broken down into phases that incrementally induct Accion's teams. The process starts with a leadership team and a transition team responsible for the overall program, followed by core delivery teams for each work stream, which work closely with the corresponding product owners and technical architects to create a detailed induction guide and delivery plan. The core team then inducts and trains the rest of the delivery team, ensures full ownership of the delivery process, and minimizes the dependence on existing vendor resources.

### Think Ahead, Plan Ahead

The transition methodology is based on a proactive plan that outlines the activities, outcomes, and participants for each transition phase. The methodology also defines the checklists, benchmarks, and metrics that provide the guardrails to highlight any deviations from the plan to allow Accion as well as the client to respond with the requisite actions and ensure a successful transition.

### Seed Teams with Existing Accion Leaders

To ensure that Accion's culture of outcome and action, rapid response, and team spirit is ingrained into the transition process, Accion ensures that a large part of the key leadership, including core delivery leaders, consists of existing Accion engineers. These leaders are experienced with Accion's transition and delivery process and ensure that the methodology is executed accurately and efficiently.

Accion executes the progressive induction by following

**Accionlabs Induction Framework (5P Model)** This methodology incorporates the five key aspects of induction: Product, Platform, People, Process, and Program across four levels: Accion, Client, Project, and Role. This tested and proven induction methodology ensures that each incremental team member of the progressive induction process works exactly as planned with minimal dependence on the individual's experience with the transition process. This also ensures adherence to the think ahead, plan ahead principle.

### Hypercare Governance Mode

For the first 90-120 days or until the last product completes the monitored ramp-up phase, Accion will operate in a Hypercare governance mode. Under this mode, there will be a daily leadership catch-up for 30 days and a weekly catchup for the remainder of 90 days. The goal of the Hypercare phase is to review resource onboarding, induction/training, progress of transition, and resolve any blockers or issues. Hypercare meetings are held at the product level and partnership levels.

- **Focus on controlling the downtime and dips**
  - System uptime & critical SLAs
  - Focus on risks & impact areas for business

- **Daily scrum for core product teams at the start and by the end of the day - Kanban**
  - Key issues & resolution
  - Team ramp-up
  - Delivery metrics
  - Work intake process progress

### 4. Monitored Ramp-Up Phase

The rest of the delivery team gets onboarded at the beginning of the monitored ramp-up phase and undergoes a rapid induction/initiation for a couple of days using the Induction package created during the initiation phase.

In the monitored ramp-up phase, the delivery teams start contributing to the code base in a way that has minimal impact on the products/applications. The team members will be monitored for their deliverables. The client tech leads will monitor the core team; however, the Accion tech leads who are part of the core team will monitor the rest of the delivery team.

**Activities:**

**Meetings / Joint Sessions / Feedback**

- Sprint grooming/planning for non-time-critical work items
- Work plan review
- Peer code review
- Test case and test script reviews
- Merge / Pull request approvals
- Approvals on support tickets
- Validation of compliance requirements

**Information required**

- Non time-critical stories/defects/support tickets that the delivery team can take up
- Approvals on work plan reviews
- Approvals on peer code reviews
- Approvals on test case and test script reviews
- Approvals on merge/pull requests

**Participants:**

- Accion: Core Team, Senior Delivery Team of all Products

The Accion delivery team will take up and deliver the following deliverables in the **monitored ramp-up phase:**

- Minor defect fixes that are non-time-critical
- Very small and small user stories
- Simple test cases and test scripts
- Support tickets that are Low-priority and non-time-critical
- Weekly report

The monitored ramp-up phase is deemed complete when the team reaches 25% of benchmarked productivity. The team is then ready to move to the next phase of Transition.

### 5. Independent Ramp-Up

After the monitored ramp-up phase is completed and team members are at least 25% productive, they move to the independent ramp-up phase. In this phase, they gain more independence and handle progressively complex work. During this phase, the team members contribute independently to the code base and take up time-critical deliverables. This phase continues until they achieve at least 80% productivity.

**Activities:**

**Meetings / Joint Sessions**

In the Independent Ramp-Up phase, no additional meetings are required except for the regular team meetings/cadences and team collaboration.

### Transition Team

The transition team is a specialized group that oversees the transition process. They begin their work as soon as Project Belvedere is approved. The transition team consists of the following members.

#### Transition Manager

- The transition manager is responsible for the overall transition process.
- The transition manager collaborates with client product owners and architects/tech leads to collect existing documentation around the application, resource rosters etc.

#### Application Architects

- An application architect will be assigned to each Product, and they will document the understanding of application features/functions, different architectural patterns, technologies used and their purposes, coding guidelines, APIs, current documentation etc.
- After the successful completion of the transition process, the application architects will join the foundation team which will be responsible for executing the innovation-driven transformation projects.
- The application architects will involve Accion's COE leaders (listed below) on a need basis:
  - **DevOps / Cloud CoE architect**
    - The DevOps/Cloud architect is responsible for mapping out the different deployment strategies for each product. They will also review the infrastructure (whether cloud or on-premise) and document their findings.
  - **Data CoE Architect**
    - The data architect documents the understanding of different data sources, flows, databases, structures, pipelines, transformations etc.
  - **QA / Automation CoE Architect**
    - The QA / Automation architect is responsible for analyzing the current test scripts, test cases, automation tools used, test processes etc.

#### Site Leader (one for each geo)

- The site leader manages various locations where Accion resources are housed. Their job is to ensure the logistics and resources required are allocated promptly.

#### HR Team Lead (one for each geo)

- The HR leads' responsibility is to conduct the rebadging process.

#### Recruitment Leads (one for each geo)

- The recruitment team hires and builds a delivery team.

#### Finance / Admin Lead

- Manages timesheets, billing, and invoicing.
- Provides special reports on logistics and operations.
- Provides periodic reports on SLAs and metrics

#### Infrastructure & Networking Lead(s)

- The networking Lead establishes the infrastructure necessary for the delivery teams to connect to the client's infrastructure successfully.

After the transition is complete, the key members of this group will collaborate with the client to form a dedicated operations team.

### Core Delivery Team

The core delivery team is a subset of the overall delivery team that will be assigned to different products. The objective of the core team in the transition phase is to gain as much understanding of the products as possible.

The delivery team includes the following members:

#### Product Tech Leads

Each product will have a dedicated tech lead assigned. The tech lead is responsible for understanding the code, modules, different workflows in the application, database and its structures, APIs, etc. The tech lead owns the technical delivery and product code.

#### Architects

The architects in the team will perform architectural analysis of current products, document the best practices, coding guidelines, development process, code branching strategies, different development/test environments etc. They work closely with the current architects at the client / vendors along with product tech leads.

#### Senior Developers

A select few senior developers will be assigned to each product. The senior developers will work closely with the tech leads to understand the code.

#### Delivery Managers

The delivery managers oversee the overall project delivery. Large products will have a dedicated delivery manager, whereas smaller products will have delivery managers with shared responsibility.

#### Scrum Masters

The scrum masters own the product backlog. They work with the product owners to understand the products and their active backlog. The scrum masters are responsible for removing any impediments for the development/delivery teams.

### Delivery Team

The rest of the delivery team is an extension of the core delivery team. This team will be assembled and allocated during the ramp-up phases. This team will primarily consist of:

- Sr. Developers
- Developers
- Sr. QA Engineers
- QA Engineers

## Sprint 0

Sprint 0 is typically planned and defined in projects where all the above transition activities occur within 2-4 weeks. Sprint 0 is planned for 2 weeks or longer depending on the project's complexity, technical understanding etc. For smaller projects, Sprint 0 can be completed in 3-5 days.

The following table shows a sample sprint 0 plan:

![Sprint 0 Plan](../assets/media/sprint0-plan.png)

## Product Heatmap

The product heatmap method is an effective method to make the product development landscape along with the knowledge of the individual modules immediately understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It also provides a standardized way to assess different aspects of the product, ensuring consistency in evaluation across teams and components. This approach also helps in maintaining transparency across the organization and facilitates better decision-making at all levels of product development.

**Data Collection Methods:**

1. **Component-wise Assessment:** As shown in the image, break down the product into key dimensions like Feature, Functionality, Workflows, Architecture, Front End, Database, Interfaces, Integrations, and Automation. This granular approach ensures no aspect of the product is overlooked.

2. **Scoring System:** Implement a clear 3-point scoring system (similar to Red-Amber-Green system):
   - **3 (Green):** Fully complete
   - **2 (Amber):** Partially complete/needs clarification
   - **1 (Red):** Not Started

3. **Priority Tagging:** Features are marked with priority indicators to help teams focus on critical components first.
