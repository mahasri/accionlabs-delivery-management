## Transition Planning Approach and Methodology

### Transition Methodology Overview

This document describes Accion's methodology and approach to transitioning work from a range of customers' internally managed and vendor-managed teams to an integrated Accion-managed extended delivery center (EDC) composed of product engineering teams at Accionlabs.

### Transition Methodology

Accion's transition methodology is built on proven principles that ensure successful delivery center transitions with minimal disruption and maximum efficiency.

#### Low Touch Induction

- **Minimal dependency** on existing vendor or client teams
- **Product, architecture & code walkthrough** - high-level overview only
- **Team swims in code** - hands-on discovery approach
- **Q&A-based transition** rather than lengthy detailed sessions
- **Self-managed learning** with progressive team induction

#### Train the Trainer Model

- **Core team learns first** - leadership and transition team
- **Knowledge capture** in comprehensive induction guide
- **Core team trains** remaining delivery team members
- **Documentation & video recordings** for reference and new joiners
- **Progressive ownership transfer** with minimal vendor dependence

#### Think Ahead, Plan Ahead

- **Proactive transition plan** with defined phases, activities, and outcomes
- **Clear benchmarks & metrics** to track progress
- **Deviation alerts** for timely corrective actions
- **Detailed checklists** for each transition phase

#### Seed Teams with Accion Leaders

- **Experienced Accion engineers** in key leadership roles
- **Culture transfer** of outcome-focused delivery approach
- **Proven transition expertise** ensures methodology execution

#### Hypercare Governance (90-120 days)

**Daily Operations**

- **Daily leadership catchup** for first 30 days
- **Daily scrum** for core product teams (start and end of day)
- **Daily reporting** to client & Accion leadership on:
  - Transition status and team ramp-up
  - Delivery metrics and work intake progress
  - Blockers, issues, and risk mitigation

**Weekly Leadership Review**

- **Engagement performance review**
- **Recruitment status** and team scaling
- **Schedule and financial review**
- **Risk management** and mitigation plans

**Focus Areas**

- **System uptime** and critical SLA adherence
- **Minimize downtime** during transition
- **Transition Manager assigned** for smooth execution
- **Tight adherence** to transition plan with continuous monitoring

## Phase-wise Transition Plan

Accion's transition process comprises several detailed phases designed to ensure a smooth and efficient transition. This comprehensive process includes the following phases:

1. Prepare
2. Plan
3. Initiate
4. Monitored Ramp Up
5. Independent Ramp Up
6. Operationalize

## Sprint 0

Sprint 0 is typically planned and defined in projects where all the above transition activities occur within 2-4 weeks. Sprint 0 is planned for 2 weeks or longer depending on the project's complexity, technical understanding etc. For smaller projects, Sprint 0 can be completed in 3-5 days.

The following table shows a sample sprint 0 plan:

## Product Heatmap

The product heatmap method is an effective method to make the product development landscape along with the knowledge of the individual modules immediately understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It also provides a standardized way to assess different aspects of the product, ensuring consistency in evaluation across teams and components. This approach also helps in maintaining transparency across the organization and facilitates better decision-making at all levels of product development.

**Data Collection Methods:**

1. **Component-wise Assessment:** As shown in the image, break down the product into key dimensions like Feature, Functionality, Workflows, Architecture, Front End, Database, Interfaces, Integrations, and Automation. This granular approach ensures no aspect of the product is overlooked.

2. **Scoring System:** Implement a clear 3-point scoring system (similar to Red-Amber-Green system):
   - **3 (Green):** Fully complete
   - **2 (Amber):** Partially complete/needs clarification
   - **1 (Red):** Not Started

3. **Priority Tagging:** Features are marked with priority indicators to help teams focus on critical components first.
