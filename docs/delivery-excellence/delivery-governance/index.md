# Delivery Governance

The Delivery Governance framework encompasses our comprehensive approach to ensuring quality, compliance, and strategic alignment across all delivery activities. This section provides detailed guidance on governance frameworks and value board processes.

## üèõÔ∏è Value Board Governance Framework

While regular operations are monitored and measured by the delivery team, **Value Board** acts as the org-wide program management body that aims to review projects across all accounts in different aspects aligned to Accion's 5P principles.

The Value Board serves as the strategic oversight mechanism that transcends individual project boundaries, providing a holistic view of organizational performance and value delivery. It ensures that all delivery activities align with Accion's core principles while maintaining the highest standards of quality and efficiency.

## ü¶Ö Value Board Review Streams

The Value Board operates through two specialized review streams, each focusing on distinct areas of excellence. This dual-stream approach ensures comprehensive coverage of both program management and technical architecture aspects, creating a balanced governance structure that addresses the full spectrum of delivery challenges.
