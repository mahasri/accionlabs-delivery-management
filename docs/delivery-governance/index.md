## Accionlabs Value Board (AVB & PVB)

### Governance Framework

The Accionlabs Governance Framework operates on a structured two-tier model that defines clear focus areas at each level:

<img src="/accion-delivery-handbook/assets/media/image25.png" style="width:6.47396in;height:3.11824in" />

#### Tier 1: Operational Monitoring (Regular Project Management)

Project teams maintain continuous oversight of delivery metrics and operational excellence through rigorous monitoring. This includes tracking sprint velocity, defect density, and rework efficiency metrics. Teams measure delivery maturity through DORA metrics - monitoring deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service. Project health is assessed through team collaboration indicators like PR review efficiency, merge frequency, and QA automation coverage. Regular tracking of feature delivery and milestone achievements ensures projects stay on course while maintaining quality standards. This tier represents the fundamental day-to-day project management activities essential for successful delivery.

#### Tier 2: Strategic Governance (Value Board)

The Value Board provides strategic oversight through two specialized units:

The Architecture Value Board (AVB) focuses exclusively on technical excellence through platform architecture assessment, design reviews, and code quality governance. AVB ensures architectural standards and innovation are consistently maintained across the organization's project portfolio through rigorous technical oversight and maturity evaluation. The review is conducted by the key architects and engineering heads of Accionlabs who are part of the core [AVB Team](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EQCWp_62JhTpxxPldP0wY02WjnKt9Rp5YDfZTGzVeA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

The Program Value Board (PVB) oversees the broader aspects of delivery capabilities including process maturity, project management excellence, people capability development, and product knowledge management. PVB's comprehensive oversight extends to customer satisfaction tracking and continuous improvement initiatives, ensuring programmatic excellence across all non-technical aspects of delivery. The review is conducted by key delivery leaders along with the PMO team.

This two-tier model establishes a clear hierarchy - with operational monitoring providing the foundation through day-to-day project management, while the Value Board drives strategic direction and governance at an organizational level. The framework enables Accionlabs to maintain high delivery standards and drive continuous improvement while keeping execution agile and efficient.

Through this structured governance approach, the organization ensures consistent quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction across its accounts.

### Review Process

Accionlabs Value Board operates as a comprehensive governance framework where Program Value Board, Architecture Value Board, and CoE/LOB/AIC teams collaborate with delivery teams to drive excellence and innovation.

The Value Board reviews focus on multiple dimensions of delivery effectiveness:

- Process and skill maturity assessment
- Customer and employee satisfaction tracking
- Product knowledge and backlog health
- Tools adoption and automation coverage
- Architecture maturity and technical debt
- ROI and business value metrics

<img src="/accion-delivery-handbook/assets/media/image26.png" style="width:6.43229in;height:3.21615in" />

Through regular program and technology reviews, the Value Board teams work with delivery leaders to evaluate the current state and recommend targeted improvements. These recommendations primarily focus on:

- Enhancing delivery productivity
- Improving quality metrics
- Optimizing delivery speed
- Driving automation adoption
- Exploring GenAI opportunities
- Streamlining processes

#### Review Outcome

The review outcomes generate specific action items at two levels:

**Team Level:**
- Immediate process improvements
- Skill development recommendations
- Tool adoption guidance

**Organizational Level:**
- Strategic initiatives
- Best practice sharing
- Cross-team collaboration opportunities
