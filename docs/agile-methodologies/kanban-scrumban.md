# Kanban / Scrumban

## Kanban

Kanban is a widely used framework for implementing Agile and DevOps software development. It emphasizes real-time communication, transparency, and efficiency in workflow management. Work items are visually represented on a Kanban board, allowing teams to track progress and optimize their processes effectively.

Here's how you structure your kanban flow.

**Visualize workflow:** Start by mapping out your team's workflow on a Kanban board. Whether physical or digital, the board should clearly depict each stage of the development process, from task initiation to completion.

**Standardize workflow**: Define and standardize the stages of your workflow to align with your team's processes and requirements. Common stages include **To Do**, **In Progress,** and **Done**, but you can customize them to reflect your unique workflow.

**Identify blockers and dependencies**: Ensure that the Kanban board highlights blockers and dependencies in real time. This transparency enables quick resolution and prevents workflow disruptions.

**Set Work-in-progress (WIP) limits**: Establish WIP limits for each workflow stage to prevent task overload and maintain a steady workflow.

**Encourage Collaboration**: Encourage teamwork by creating a collaborative culture where members proactively address bottlenecks and ensure smooth workflow progression.

**Utilize Kanban cards:** Represent tasks using Kanban cards, which should include key details such as task description, assignee, and estimated completion time. These cards facilitate visual task tracking and promote transparency.

### Kanban Board

The Kanban board is a central tool for Kanban teams, it provides a visual representation of work progress. While some teams use physical boards, digital Kanban boards offer better traceability, collaboration, and accessibility across locations.

A typical Kanban board consists of three primary workflow stages:

- To-Do
- In Progress
- Done

### Kanban cards

Kanban cards contain essential information about project tasks, including assignee details, task descriptions, and estimated completion times. Virtual Kanban boards may also include screenshots and technical details relevant to the task.

### Benefits of the Kanban framework:

1. **Planning flexibility:** Kanban teams focus only on work currently in progress. When a task is completed, the team selects the next one from the backlog. The product owner can reprioritize backlog items without disrupting ongoing work.

2. **Shortened time cycles:** Cycle time—the duration a task takes from start to completion—is a crucial metric in Kanban. By optimizing cycle time, teams can improve efficiency and accurately forecast future work deliveries.

3. **Fewer bottlenecks:** WIP limits help highlight and eliminate bottlenecks caused by insufficient focus, staffing, or skill gaps.

4. **Visual metrics for Continuous Improvement:** Kanban emphasizes continuous improvement through data-driven insights. Teams use visual reports, such as control charts and cumulative flow diagrams, to identify inefficiencies and streamline processes.

   - Control charts track cycle time trends, helping teams improve consistency.
   - Cumulative flow diagrams visualize work distribution, ensuring balanced workload management.

5. **Continuous Delivery**: Continuous delivery (CD) involves frequent releases of work to customers, while continuous integration (CI) ensures automated building and testing of code throughout the day. Together, CI/CD pipelines enable DevOps teams to ship high-quality software faster.

Kanban and continuous delivery complement each other by emphasizing just-in-time value delivery. The faster a team can innovate and release products, the more competitive they become.

## Scrumban

Scrumban is a hybrid Agile Project Management methodology that combines the structured approach of Scrum with the continuous improvement and flexibility of Kanban, allowing teams to benefit from Scrum's structured approach while incorporating Kanban's flexibility and focus on continuous improvement. This hybrid method helps teams adapt to changes more efficiently and optimize their processes over time.
