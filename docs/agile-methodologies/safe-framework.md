# SAFe Agile Framework

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a collection of organizational workflow patterns designed to implement agile practices at the enterprise level. SAFe fosters alignment, collaboration, and efficient delivery across multiple agile teams.

SAFe integrates Lean, Agile, and DevOps principles and provides a comprehensive operating system that enables enterprises to thrive in the digital age—delivering innovative products and services faster, more predictably, and with higher quality.

## Roles in SAFe

SAFe teams typically comprise several critical roles that work together to drive success:

**Product Owner:** Manages the product backlog and oversees iteration planning. They communicate high-level goals and the overall vision to the agile team.

**Product Manager:** Articulates the program vision and upcoming milestones, ensuring that business outcomes align with and deliver value to customers.

**Engineering Director:** Leads the Agile Release Train and is responsible for planning, managing, and facilitating the Program Increment (PI) planning events.

**Scrum Master:** Facilitates team processes, ensures adherence to agile best practices, and works to remove any impediments that hinder progress.

**Developers:** Collaborate with the Product Owner to refine user stories, identify potential risks, and finalize PI objectives.

## SAFe Implementation Process

### Step 1. Requirement Gathering

The Product Owner collects customer requirements and transforms them into epics. Effort for each epic is estimated using T-shirt sizing (e.g., XL, L, M, S), and a VUCA rating (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) is assigned to indicate the level of confidence in each estimate.

### Step 2. Product Board

The Product Board serves as a visual workspace for innovation, enabling teams to dream, design, and build their future together. In this phase, Program Increment (PI) items planned for the quarter are distributed across six sprints. The Product Owner organizes these items sprint by sprint using a Miro board.

**Tools Spotlight: JIRA and Confluence**

- **JIRA:** Used for project management, JIRA allows teams to create user stories, tasks, log defects, and track progress through custom workflows.

- **Confluence:** Acts as a central hub for collaboration. With shared calendars and documentation, it offers transparency and helps the team track the sprint cadence and overall project progress.

### Step 3. PI Planning

The Product Owner leads the PI planning process by gathering customer feedback, suggestions, and requirements. These inputs are prioritized, transformed into epics, and then integrated into the Program Increment (PI).

### Step 4. Product Backlog

After PI planning, the Product Owner breaks down epics into user stories and tasks. These items are then organized in the product backlog in order of priority.

### Step 5. Sprint Refinement

During sprint refinement, the entire team reviews and refines the backlog items. The Product Owner explains each work item while the team raises questions or highlights concerns, ensuring clarity and readiness for development.

### Step 6. Sprint Planning

In sprint planning—facilitated by the Product Owner and Scrum Master—the team determines which refined work items will be completed in the upcoming sprint and outlines the approach to achieving these goals. Effort estimates are finalized, and developers are assigned tasks accordingly.

- **Sprint:** A sprint is a short, time-boxed period (typically two weeks) during which the team collaborates to achieve a specific sprint goal.

- **Daily Standup:** This is a 15-minute meeting involving the core team (Product Owner, developers, and Scrum Master). Each member briefly shares what they accomplished the previous day, what they plan to work on today, and any impediments they are facing.

### Step 7. Sprint Review

At the end of the sprint, the development team and stakeholders gather for the sprint review. During this meeting, developers demonstrate the completed work, gather feedback, and ensure that the output aligns with the product vision and requirements.

### Step 8. Sprint Retrospective

Following the sprint review, the team holds a sprint retrospective. This meeting provides an opportunity to reflect on what went well, identify challenges, and discuss improvements for future sprints.
