I'll help you convert and save the images. However, I need to clarify that I cannot directly save the images you showed me to the file system. 

Let me update the AHM/Townhall page to use a simpler approach that will work better, and provide you with the exact file names needed:

## Required Image Files:

You'll need to save the 20 images as PNG files in `/docs/assets/ahm-slides/` with these exact names:

1. `slide-1.png` - "ALL HANDS MEET JANUARY 2025"
2. `slide-2.png` - "Agenda 2025" 
3. `slide-3.png` - "WELCOME ADDRESS by Anand Raja"
4. `slide-4.png` - "Tunisia Visit..." with photos
5. `slide-5.png` - "Year 2024 - Accion Delivery Dashboard"
6. `slide-6.png` - "REFLECTION 2024"
7. `slide-7.png` - "Collaboration / Coordination"
