# Transition Kick-Off

Both the sales and delivery teams need to work closely during the handoff process to ensure a smooth transition and successful project execution. Additionally, the specific documents used may vary depending on the Scope, Type of Project, Project complexity, EDC Model, and the preferences of the involved parties.

Right after the deal closure, the sales team and the delivery team for the project initiate handover & pre-kickoff meetings. The handover meetings are very crucial for the team to deliver successfully and create a good first impression with the client.

## Pre-Kickoff

The sales team shares all the relevant documents with complete information on various project management activities and expectations agreed upon with the client.

- SLA, MSA and SoW Agreed Upon
- Domain and Customer business information
- Product / Project Background and documents
- Requirements document
- Technology and required skills

## Handover Meeting
