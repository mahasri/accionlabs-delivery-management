# Project Initiation

## Extended Delivery Center (EDC) Model

Our Extended Delivery Center is based on Accion's core value propositions of co-development, virtual teams, and a 100% white-box approach. In an EDC engagement model, Accion owns the entire responsibility of delivery. This is based on Accion's strong operational and governance models with a focus on value creation.

### Key Components

- [100% White-box Model - Approach](#100-white-box-model---approach)
- [EDC Models and Options](#edc-models)
- [Typical EDC Delivery Organization](#typical-edc-delivery-organization)
- [Customer Collaboration Models](#customer-collaboration-models)
- [EDC Phases](#edc-phases)

The delivery practices & processes are defined and streamlined between the teams onsite and offshore. The team defines the process, governance, and tools that will be used to plan, prioritize and execute defined projects & programs.

### Our EDC is powered by:

- Accion's participation in the product roadmap, tools, and the selection of technology
- The whole team that participates in account growth, the creation of value, and innovation
- Influencing process best practices, checklists, templates, etc.
- An Engagement Manager who works closely with delivery, builds customer relationships, Handles escalations and new SOWs
- The team who can recommend sourcing and skill needs that provide maximum ROI
- A delivery team that runs projects also drives growth through delivery-driven sales
- An autonomous engineering team that can co-learn, measure performance, boost productivity and identify risks & pre-empt issues early.

## 100% White-box Model - Approach

The White-box Model approach is based on the following principles.

- Philosophy of "co-development" & "virtual teams"
- Completely opposite to the traditional "black box" model of outsourcing
- Provides a range of services (New Dev, Sustenance, QA, Support, PS, etc.)
- Built on a Strong Operational framework and Mature Governance model
- Fosters true partnership and joint ownership through equal investments
- Offers a well-defined process with guidelines, checklists, tools, templates, etc
- Structured and Repeatable processes right from the start

### Leadership team

The leadership team comprises the key decision-makers of both the client and Accionlabs. This team will be involved in defining the strategic goals, and delivery expectations. Delivery managers are spread to manage a group of projects

### Dedicated Teams

The teams are usually grouped based on the product/module they manage for the client. The teams are a mix of lead developers, architects, senior and junior engineers and QA teams, etc based on project priorities, schedule, and project goals. Few resources can be shared between projects like Ops, Design, BA, Architects, etc.

### Support Teams

For any successful EDC model, it is important to have the HR, IT admin, Ops support, and TA teams in sync with the functional and operations expectations of the client

**Tech CoEs**

The core Center of Excellence team from Accionlabs with specialization in specific areas is involved in this group. They support periodical conversations with the team and provide the right guidance and recommendations based on project needs.

## Customer Collaboration Models

Based on the type of EDC model, the collaboration & communication with the customers vary. Our Accion team org structure is also defined based on the defined model.

## EDC Phases

The Engagement Delivery Cycle (EDC) outlines four sequential phases for successful project execution:

**PLAN → INITIATE → RAMP UP → OPERATE**

Each phase has distinct deliverables and involves specific stakeholders from both client and delivery teams, progressing from initial planning through full operational delivery. The visual below explains the key deliverables and stakeholder involvement across phases, demonstrating how the engagement scales from the core planning team to a complete execution team.

This structured approach ensures organized transition from engagement planning to operational delivery while maintaining clear ownership and responsibilities throughout the project lifecycle.
