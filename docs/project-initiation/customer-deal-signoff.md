# Customer Deal Sign-Off

When a sales team closes a deal with a customer, they typically follow the steps below and prepare related documents to ensure a smooth hand-off to the delivery team. Below are the different types of documents that are prepared by the sales team in collaboration with the client stakeholders.

## Statement of Work (SOW)

The sales team conducts multiple discussions with respective customer stakeholders (Product owners, Analysts, Engineering Managers, etc.), and a comprehensive SoW document is prepared that outlines the scope of the project, including product scope, technology, expected deliverables, milestones, timelines, and responsibilities.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

This is more applicable to projects that involve managing support services. An SLA defines the levels of service that the client can expect, including response times, resolution times, and other performance metrics. It sets expectations for the quality of service to be provided.

Few customers define SLA thresholds to few metrics which attract a penalty if not met. It is important to have the expectations written in the SLA document.

## Master Services Agreement (MSA)

The MSA is a legal document containing the overarching terms and conditions that are applicable during the service period and at times few conditions apply for a specific period even after the agreed service contract period is over. It may cover issues such as payment terms, confidentiality, intellectual property rights etc. These are very important factors to be aware of in detail by both the sales and the delivery team.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

An NDA is a legal contract that ensures the confidentiality of the information shared between the client and the service provider. This contract helps protect the customer from any violation and it creates a very severe impact on the engagement in case of any breach.

## Client Sign-off

Formal sign-off document to acknowledge that the client has reviewed the deliverables, and agreements and approved them. This document can be important for avoiding disputes later in the project. The sales team details all assumptions and considerations that help in setting the expectations right for the customer.
