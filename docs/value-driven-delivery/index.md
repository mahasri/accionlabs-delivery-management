# Value Driven Delivery

Our Delivery Management approach is outlined to ensure our projects do not just meet the defined milestones but deliver real value to our customers on an ongoing basis. This can be achieved by building more "empathy" towards the customer and their current and future interests. It is paramount for every delivery leader to develop the capabilities listed below:

- Understand the domain, business, and target market of the customers.
- Have meaningful conversations with customers and make every interaction count.
- Address customer concerns promptly and provide effective suggestions.
- Engage closely with customers and explore value opportunities.
- Build strong relationships with customers by introducing regular feedback loops & collaboration.

## Core Delivery Capabilities

### Logistics

The foundation of a value-oriented delivery is doing the basics right & building effective communication channels - Meaningful Agenda, Minutes, Regular calls, Global thinking, powerful templates & planning are a few ways to ensure the logistics are in place.

### Biz Knowledge & Execution

Understand customer business, products, services; their market, differentiating factors, and end users and their challenges. These actions pave the way for identifying successful value opportunities. It is also important to establish the trust of the customer with meticulous implementation of Delivery Best Practices and ensuring all the promises/commitments made during the project sign-off are met.

### Project Management Communication

It is very critical to have effective communication with client stakeholders periodically and with a very well-planned schedule, agenda, and content. Multiple meetings and reports viz WSR, Biweekly meetings, QBR etc. are important means to strengthen customer engagement. All reports should call out any risks, blockers, etc. with remedial steps to take as corrective and preventive actions. The RAG status is always shared with the client. End-end Root cause analysis is performed followed by clear action items that are tracked to closure.

### Non-PM Communication

This involves establishing connections & creating further conversations between customers and the core team of Accionlabs including the Architecture Value Board, Program Value Board, Centers of Excellence, etc. Typically, the core teams review the projects periodically from various value-driven aspects and generate reports and recommendations for improvements that are shared with customers to generate their interest in further conversations. The core teams also steer and actively contribute to various org-oriented initiatives viz Training plans, Accathons, Innovation Summit, etc. that build the right platform for deep dive conversations with customers.

## Value Creation

Value can be anything progressive done beyond the regular work assigned to the team. The intention is to always strive to deliver value across the 5Ps.

### The 5Ps Framework

**People:** Getting the right people, providing the right training for the skill required; and building a strong team and team bonding with the objective that the value should be perceived on the team more than individuals.

**Process:** Constantly identify what's working & what can be improved and recommended. e.g. include better estimation methods, Backlog grooming methods; Sequence dependencies; agile reports, and performance tracking of the team and individuals; etc.

**Product:** The team is always fully aware of the product knowledge, the business of the customer, the competitor landscape, features planned for the PI, and the roadmap, and empathizes with the end customer.

**Platform:** Build reusables, look for tools, and frameworks, find better ways to implement; improve coding best practices; checklists; have architecture advisor involved regularly, AVB.

**Project:** By continuously identifying & implementing the best practices across all stages of the project management life cycle, various avenues of value creation can be realized. Below are a few value areas that can be considered:

- **Tooling & Automation** - Identify automatable development processes to increase throughput and reduce rework
- **Shades of Green** - Eliminate Red and Amber situations & ensure progress across all aspects of software development
- **Quality Documentation** - Reduce clutter and generate meaningful and helpful content
- **GenAI / new tech applicability** - Stay on top of technology and modernization ideas and constantly strive to leverage them to scale a project
- **Design and develop reusable code**
- **Initiate implementation of POCs for large-value projects**
- **Focus on NFRs** - Security, Performance, Maintainability, Scalability, Availability, etc.
- **Accessibility** - Ensure UX / UI designs are accessibility compliant
- **Process improvements** - Constantly monitor project metrics and progress to identify areas of process improvements
- **CICD** - Automated CI/CD with continuous testing integrated is very critical to ensure smooth deployment of products
- **Time to release** - Optimize time to release by adopting automation at every stage of deployment
- **UX** - Design customer-focused experience workflow. Keep a close watch on user feedback and prioritize improvement areas
- **Cost savings** - Many value-driven initiatives can impact cost directly or indirectly. It is important to measure the cost savings viz hours reduced, increased velocity, reduced defects, etc.

## Myths around Value

There are various assumptions and myths about value:

- Only Delivery Leaders can add Value
- We created value just last year
- I am a QA/Dev/how can I add value
- The customer doesn't want us to add value
- We suggested values - customers don't listen to us
- We are only seen as a Staffing Partner

## Accion Value Approach

Cultivating a "value creation" mindset is essential across all roles and functions of a delivery life cycle and should extend beyond individual responsibilities, with an emphasis on limitless value addition. It serves as a consistent driving force to make a meaningful impact in our engagements.

## Value Mindset

Here is the list of different value areas that are driven at all levels & roles involved in software delivery:

<img src="../assets/media/image17.png" style="width:5.51563in;height:5.45325in" />

### Scrum Team: Collaborative Execution

Code quality, CI/CD, QA Automation, Accessibility, UX, Tools, NFR Monitoring and improvements, Processes, and standards, etc.

### Engineering & PO Team: Delivery Excellence

Standards and Best Practices, Metrics & KPIs, NFRs, Roadmap, Agile, Stories, PI Plans etc.

### Delivery Team: Strategic Delivery

New Tech applicability, Value reviews with AVB, PVB team, Stakeholder management, Metrics & KPIs, Cost Savings, Shades of Green across 5Ps.

### Core Team: Drive Value & Innovation

Technology Innovations, References, Summits, Strategic initiatives through Architecture, and program value board.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Value Assessment
- Business value identification
- Stakeholder value mapping
- Success metrics definition

### Phase 2: Value Delivery
- Value-driven prioritization
- Agile value delivery
- Continuous value measurement

### Phase 3: Value Optimization
