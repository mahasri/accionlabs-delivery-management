# Myths around Value

There are various assumptions and myths about value: Only Delivery Leaders can add Value

- We created value just last year

- I am a QA/Dev/how can I add value

- The customer doesn't want us to add value

- We suggested values - customers don't listen to us

- We are only seen as a Staffing Partner
