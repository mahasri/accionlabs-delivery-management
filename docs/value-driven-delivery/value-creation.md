# Value Creation

Value can be anything progressive done beyond the regular work assigned to the team. The intention is to always strive to deliver value across the 5Ps.

**People:** Getting the right people, providing the right training for the skill required; and building a strong team and team bonding with the objective that the value should be perceived on the team more than individuals

**Process:** Constantly identify what's working & what can be improved and recommended. e.g. include better estimation methods, Backlog grooming methods; Sequence dependencies; agile reports, and performance tracking of the team and individuals; etc.

**Product:** The team is always fully aware of the product knowledge, the business of the customer, the competitor landscape, features planned for the PI, and the roadmap, and empathizes with the end customer

**Platform:** Build reusables, look for tools, and frameworks, find better ways to implement; improve coding best practices; checklists; have architecture advisor involved regularly, AVB,

**Project:** By continuously identifying & implementing the best practices across all stages of the project management life cycle, various avenues of value creation can be realized. Below are a few value areas that can be considered

- Tooling & Automation
  - Identify automatable development processes to increase throughput and reduce rework

- Shades of Green
  - Eliminate Red and Amber situations & ensure progress across all aspects of software development.

- Quality Documentation
  - Reduce clutter and generate meaningful and helpful content

- GenAI / new tech applicability
  - Stay on top of technology and modernization ideas and constantly strive to leverage them to scale a project

- Design and develop reusable code

- Initiate implementation of POCs for large-value projects

- Focus on NFRs - Security, Performance, Maintainability, Scalability, Availability, etc.

- Accessibility - Ensure UX / UI designs are accessibility compliant

- Process improvements - Constantly monitor project metrics and progress to identify areas of process improvements

- CICD - Automated CI/CD with continuous testing integrated is very critical to ensure smooth deployment of products

- Time to release - Optimize time to release by adopting automation at every stage of deployment

- UX - Design customer-focused experience workflow. Keep a close watch on user feedback and prioritize improvement areas

- Cost savings - Many value-driven initiatives can impact cost directly or indirectly. It is important to measure the cost savings viz hours reduced, increased velocity, reduced defects, etc.
